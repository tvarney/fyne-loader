# fyne-loader
## Overview
fyne-loader is a dynamic UI builder for the fyne UI toolkit, useful for
prototyping fyne UIs in a manner that doesn't require re-compiling between every
run.

## How it works
UI elements may be generated by loading a YAML or JSON file with the Loader
type, which returns all loaded elements from the file as a map of names to
`fyne.CanvasObject` instances. To see an example of how this works in code, see
`./cmd/example/main.go`.

The load functions only return errors when there is a YAML or JSON error that
prevents parsing of the file. Otherwise, all errors are reported through a
context object; this allows the loader to report all errors encountered, as
well as attempt to continue even when errors are present.

## Supported Widgets
The current set of supported widgets is:
* `Accordion`
* `Button`
* `HBox`
* `Label`
* `VBox`

Extra widgets which are planned to be supported are:
* `AdaptiveGrid`
* `BorderContainer`
* `Card`
* `CenterContainer`
* `Check`
* `Entry`
* `Form`
* `Grid`
* `GridWrap`
* `Hyperlink`
* `Icon`
* `MaxContainer`
* `PaddedContainer`
* `ProgressBar`
* `ProgressBarInfinite`
* `RadioGroup`
* `Scroll`
* `Select`
* `SelectEntry`
* `Separator`
* `Slider`
* `Split`
* `Tabs`
* `TextGrid`
* `Toolbar`

## Adding New Widgets
New widgets may be added by creating a function which matches the type
`CreateElementFn` and adding it to a loader with `(*Loader).RegisterElement`.
This allows adding any arbitrary element to the loader. The function given
should handle both `string` and `map[string]interface{}` values.
